    This section covers the details of the service, and focuses on what you need to know to use the service. If you want
    to understand the technical details of how the service is developed and operated, check out the [code
    repository on GitHub](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates).

    <h3 id="data" className="bulma-title bulma-is-5">Data</h3>

    The data is a combination of [the list of municipalities from
    data.norge.no](https://data.norge.no/datasets/978a923c-9ab6-3617-8fd6-6622363454e3)
    and the aggregated responses from [Kartverkets stedsnavn
    API](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates) (API for searching
    on place names, developed by the [Norwegian Mapping Authority](https://www.kartverket.no/)), providing
    municipalities with their name, municipality number, and coordinates.

    The data is expressed as a graph that can be downloaded as Turtle from
    the [code
    repository](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates/blob/main/kommunenummer-koordinater.ttl).
    Do note that the vocabularies used are slightly different from what is exposed through the service, as explained in
    the section on [vocabularies](#vocabularies).

    <h3 className="bulma-title bulma-is-5">Schema</h3>

    The graph uses a combination of [vocabularies](#vocabularies) to describe two main data structures: a Municipality
    and a Collection of municipalities. To describe these structures we can use shapes, which allow us to add
    constraints to the "shape" of a graph and determine whether it is valid.

    <h4 id="schema-municipality" className="bulma-title bulma-is-6">Shapes</h4>

    There are two competing standards to describe shapes in RDF: [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and
    [ShEx](https://shex.io/shex-semantics/index.html). There's also a compact version of SHACL,
    [SHACLC](https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-compact-syntax/#rule-propertyShape), that we wanted to use, as it
    is easier to read than the full-fledged version.

<div className="bulma-content">

    Regardless of which syntax you prefer, the shapes all mean the same:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>**Municipalities**</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ... are of type `cpov:PublicOrganization`
                </li>
                <li>
                    ... have one triple using `dcterms:identifier` (denoting municipality number)

                    ... have one triple using `amv:accuracy` (higher denoting increased accuracy in relation to the

    <h3 id="vocabularies" className="bulma-title bulma-is-5">Vocabularies</h3>

    These are the vocabularies used in the service:

    <dl>
        <dt>
            [amv](https://w3id.org/amv#)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The *Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary* is used to describe metadata about algorithms, such as search
            algorithms. Our use of `amv:accuracy` pertains to two specific values: In `/name` it denotes the score that
            was given from a fuzzy search (e.g. "Osl" will return "Os" and "Oslo"), while in `/coords` it denotes the
            distance between the municipality and the given coordinates. The latter is given as a negative number, so
            that for both the cases the most relevant result can be sorted by the highest number.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [cpov](http://data.europa.eu/m8g/)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The [*Core Public Organisation Vocabulary*](https://semiceu.github.io/CPOV/) provides terms for public
            organizations, such as municipalities, for which we denote type using `cv:PublicOrganisation`.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [dc](http://purl.org/dc/terms/)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            *DCMI Metadata Terms* provide a plethora of terms that are useful for metadata, and we make use of
            `dc:identifier` to denote the municipality number and `dc:description` to denote the name of the
            municipality.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [rdf](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            This is the core vocabulary for RDF, and is used in all RDF graphs.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [schema](https://schema.org/)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The *Schema.org vocabulary* is the product of the on-going work of [schema.org](https://schema.org/), a
            collaborative project on structured data. We use `schema:latitude` and `schema:longitude` as the best
            approximation of our representation of coordinates. Specifically we refer to their definition in the
            [ETRS89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Terrestrial_Reference_System_1989) coordinates system
            (should
            work well within Europe).
        </dd>
    </dl>

    > The prefix *kommunenummer* that you see in some of the results is not a vocabulary, but simply a shorthand for the
    base URL from which data for all municipalities were originally retrieved. (Meaning you can use this URL to retrieve
    that data if needed.)

    There are also some vocabularies used in
    the [original dataset](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates/blob/main/kommunenummer.rdf)
    that we chose to not use in our service.

    <dl>
        <dt>
            [adms](https://www.w3.org/ns/legacy_adms#)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The original dataset also contained historical municipalities that were "active" anymore, and to denote
            their status they used `adms#status`. Our dataset contains only organizationally active municipalities, so
            we didn't need that term. (Also, the vocabulary is deprecated, so we didn't want to continue the use of it.)
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [dcat](https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The *DCAT 3 Vocabulary* was used in combination with `dc:Temporal` to describe periods of time that the
            municipality had the given status.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            [skos](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#)
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The *Simple Knowledge Organization System* is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge
            organization systems. In the original dataset they used `skos:Concept` as type for the municipalities, and
            `skos:prefLabel` to denote their name. They used some other terms as well, but in the end we felt they
            didn't contribute any vital information for our service that wasn't covered by other vocabularies.
