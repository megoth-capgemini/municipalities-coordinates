<h2 id="documentation" className="bulma-title bulma-is-4">Documentation</h2>

This section covers the details of the service, and focuses on what you need to know to use the service. If you want to
understand the technical details of how the service is developed and operated, check out the [code
repository on GitHub](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates).

<h3 id="data" className="bulma-title bulma-is-5">Data</h3>

The data is a combination
of [the list of municipalities from data.norge.no](https://data.norge.no/datasets/978a923c-9ab6-3617-8fd6-6622363454e3)
and the aggregated responses
from [Kartverkets stedsnavn API](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates) (API for searching on
place names, developed by the [Norwegian Mapping Authority](https://www.kartverket.no/)), providing municipalities with
their name, municipality number, and coordinates.

The data is expressed as a graph that can be downloaded as Turtle from
the [code repository](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates/blob/main/kommunenummer-koordinater.ttl).
Do note that the vocabularies used are slightly different from what is exposed through the service, as explained in the
next section.

<h3 className="bulma-title bulma-is-5">Schema</h3>

The graph uses a combination of [vocabularies](#vocabularies) to describe two main data structures:
a [Municipality](#schema-municipality) and a [Collection of municipalities](#schema-collection-municipalities).

    </dt>
    <dd>
        The *Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary* is used to describe metadata about algorithms, such as search algorithms.
        Our use of `amv:accuracy` pertains to two specific values: In `/name` it denotes the score that was given from
        a fuzzy search (e.g. "Osl" will return "Os" and "Oslo"), while in `/coords` it denotes the distance between the
        municipality and the given coordinates. The latter is given as a negative number, so that for both the cases
        the most relevant result can be sorted by the highest number.

        The [*Core Public Organisation Vocabulary*](https://semiceu.github.io/CPOV/) provides terms for public
        organizations, such as municipalities, for which we denote type using `cv:PublicOrganisation`.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        [dc](http://purl.org/dc/terms/)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        *DCMI Metadata Terms* provide a plethora of terms that are useful for metadata, and we make use of
        `dc:identifier` to denote the municipality number and `dc:description` to denote the name of the municipality.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        [rdf](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This is the core vocabulary for RDF, and is used in all RDF graphs.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        [schema](https://schema.org/)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The *Schema.org vocabulary* is the product of the on-going work of [schema.org](https://schema.org/), a
        collaborative project on structured data. We use `schema:latitude` and `schema:longitude` as the best
        approximation of our representation of coordinates. Specifically we refer to their definition in the
        [ETRS89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Terrestrial_Reference_System_1989) coordinates system (should
        work well within Europe).

> The prefix *kommunenummer* that you see in some of the results is not a vocabulary, but simply a shorthand for the
base URL from which data for all municipalities were originally retrieved. (Meaning you can use this URL to retrieve
that data if needed.)

There are also some vocabularies used in
the [original dataset](https://github.com/megoth-capgemini/municipalities-coordinates/blob/main/kommunenummer.rdf) that
we chose to not use in our service.

<dl>
    <dt>
        [adms](https://www.w3.org/ns/legacy_adms#)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The original dataset also contained historical municipalities that were "active" anymore, and to denote their
        status they used `adms#status`. Our dataset contains only organizationally active municipalities, so we didn't
        need that term. (Also, the vocabulary is deprecated, so we didn't want to continue the use of it.)
    </dd>
    <dt>
        [dcat](https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The *DCAT 3 Vocabulary* was used in combination with `dc:Temporal` to describe periods of time that the
        municipality had the given status.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        [skos](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The *Simple Knowledge Organization System* is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge
        organization systems. In the original dataset they used `skos:Concept` as type for the municipalities, and
        `skos:prefLabel` to denote their name. They used some other terms as well, but in the end we felt they didn't
        contribute any vital information for our service that wasn't covered by other vocabularies.
